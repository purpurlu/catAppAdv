# What is CORS and Why is it needed?

   It is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control and restrict web page scripts (typically JavaScript) from making requests to a domain different from the one that served the web page. In other words, it defines a set of rules that determine whether a web page running on one domain is allowed to request resources from a different domain.
   
##  Reasons why CORS is used:
   - Security
   - Privacy
   - Isolation
   - Data Integrity
   - Access Control
